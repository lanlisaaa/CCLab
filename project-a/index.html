                <p>
                    A round cell with a nucleus that changes color as it goes through different emotions.
                    She sends magenta electric signals to all parts of the cell
                    and spits purple teeth for self-defense purposes when pressure is applied.

                <ul>
                    <li>She calls out for help every time she detects that the individual is under pressure. </li>
                    <li>If her alert is left unattended, her help signals would form a huge net to trap her.</li>
                    <li>She sends magenta electric signals to all parts of the cell
                        and spits purple spikes for self-defense purposes when pressure is applied.
                    </li>
                    <li>When she changes color depending on her mood. She turns red when she is enraged.
                        She turns blue. If she’s experiencing a mixed feelings of these two emotions,
                        the colors would combine itself.</li>

                The purpose of her existence is to remind people to take care of their mental health.
                She appears when individuals are under pressure or experience a traumatic event, and hates being
                ignored.
                Many people’s first reaction is to repress her every time she appears. However,
                the more you try to repress her the more frantic she gets.
